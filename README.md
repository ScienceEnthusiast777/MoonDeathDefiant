a simple sketch for a puzzle stealth platformer where the player controls a moon. The mood has two states: full and half. 
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
While the moon is half they can run and jump...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
but when they are tackled by and enemy they become whole, and can only roll. The player must then find a green potion to become half again. 
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The enemy will stop and glare at the player when they are on the same x-axis, and then charge when the player gets too close!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The idea was to have a series of levels which increase in complexity where the player has to navigate to the end managing their current state to be able to traverse various obstacles.

This project was created when I was first learning C# and has been on pause for the time being as I concentrate on web development projects. I still intend one day to come back and finish it off.
